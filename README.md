### Links

- Live Site URL: [Here the link!](https://minleya.github.io/social-proof-section/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Really I'm happy that I just made this project because there was tough times for me when I started this challenge. So the main interesting thing that I learned is CSS grid. Ofc I didn't use it in this project bc I found out that I can make this page only with Flexbox only AFTER learning CSS grid. *sigh* well whatever it was intersting experience.


### Useful resources
